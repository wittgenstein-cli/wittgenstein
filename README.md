> _Die Grenzen meiner Sprache bedeuten die Grenzen meiner Welt._ — Tractatus 5.6

The limits of a language model's expression are the limits of what a harness built on top
of it can plan. Wittgenstein's response is to extend what the model can **express as structured
files** — schemas, codec IR, latent codes — rather than what it can **say in tokens**. The
expressive contract lives in code, not prompt copy.

> **🧪 Project status — early-stage, doctrine-locked.** Wittgenstein is a prerelease
> (`v0.2.0-alpha.1`) with a working Python surface, a production-shaped TypeScript
> harness, and a few intentionally unfinished surfaces clearly flagged with ⚠️ or 🔴 in
> [`docs/implementation-status.md`](docs/implementation-status.md). The v0.2 cut locks
> the thesis, vocabulary, and codec protocol (RFC-0001 / ADR-0008); the next phase is
> the M0 → M5b execution against [`docs/exec-plans/active/codec-v2-port.md`](docs/exec-plans/active/codec-v2-port.md).
> Breaking changes are still possible before `0.1.0`. **We are actively looking for

## Why this exists

Most "multimodal AI" stacks hide the hard parts in a fused frontier model, a paid cloud
API, or the slide deck. None of those are portable, inspectable, or reproducible.

Wittgenstein makes three architectural bets instead:

- **Text LLMs, not fused multimodal giants.** The base model stays text-only. Modality-specific
  work lives in codec layers. Cross-modal grounding is already inside the LLM — the adapter
  teaches the interface, not the knowledge. ([research/frozen-llm-multimodality.md](docs/research/frozen-llm-multimodality.md))
- **Decoder, not generator.** Frozen VQ decoders over diffusion samplers. Reproducibility is
  structural — same IR + same seed → same bytes — not a policy bolt-on. ([research/vq-tokens-as-interface.md](docs/research/vq-tokens-as-interface.md))
- **Traceable by construction.** Every run writes a manifest with git SHA, lockfile hash,
  seed, full LLM input/output, and artifact SHA-256. Runs replay bit-exactly. ([reproducibility.md](docs/reproducibility.md))

## Showcase — 35 real artifacts you can open right now

Numbers are cheap; files are not. The pack below was generated end-to-end through the
harness — every artifact has a matching run manifest under `artifacts/runs/<run-id>/`.
This showcase is a preserved snapshot from the `v0.1.0-alpha.1` hackathon phase: the
first 35-file pack we used to prove the workflow could emit real artifacts across image,
audio, and sensor routes.

It is intentionally kept as a historical receipt, not a claim that every artifact already
matches the post-lock `v0.2` architecture one-for-one. As the codec-v2 port, decoder
contracts, and manifest spine continue to harden, this showcase pack will be refreshed
with newer curated outputs rather than silently rewritten in place.
Treat it as a human-browsable artifact gallery, not as the active execution brief for
agents; current implementation guidance lives in the codec-v2 plan and agent guides.

## Architecture (Five Layers)

```
 User prompt
      │
      ▼
  L1 HARNESS          routing · retry · budget · manifest · seed
      │
      ▼
  L2 CODEC / SPEC     LLM → structured JSON Spec (scene spec / audio plan / signal spec)
      │   ▲           IR is a sum type: Text | Latent | Hybrid (only Text inhabited at v0.2)

      │               audio:  WAV synth + ambient   → WAV / M4A
      │               sensor: operator expand       → CSV + loupe HTML
      ▼
  L4 ADAPTER          text embedding → latent code alignment (image only; tiny MLP)

Every layer has a named home in the repo; no layer is "implied in prompts." Vocabulary
is locked in [`docs/glossary.md`](docs/glossary.md); the full layer mapping lives in
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md); the codec contract is
[`docs/codec-protocol.md`](docs/codec-protocol.md) (ratified by ADR-0008).

## Quickstart (30 seconds, no API key)

```bash
cd polyglot-mini
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m polyglot.cli sensor "ECG 72 bpm resting" --dry-run --out /tmp/ecg.json
open /tmp/ecg.html    # self-contained interactive dashboard, zero deps
```

What you get:

```
/tmp/
├── ecg.json    operator spec + 2,500 samples
├── ecg.csv     timeSec,value
├── ecg.png     matplotlib chart
└── ecg.html    117 KB interactive loupe dashboard
```

## Two surfaces, one architecture

| Surface                | Lives at         | Best for                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Python prototype**   | `polyglot-mini/` | Rapid iteration, demos, adapter training, hackathon velocity |
| **TypeScript harness** | `packages/*`     | Typed contracts, strict CI gates, production distribution    |

Both implement the same five layers. Start on the Python side, graduate to TypeScript when
the codec design is stable. See [`docs/extending.md`](docs/extending.md) for the porting recipe.

---

## CLI

```bash
# Python surface — full end-to-end, works today
python3 -m polyglot.cli image  "stormy ocean at midnight"      --out ocean.png
python3 -m polyglot.cli tts    "Cozy rainy afternoon."         --out voice.m4a
python3 -m polyglot.cli sensor "ECG 72 bpm resting" --dry-run  --out ecg.json

# TypeScript surface — typed harness, manifest spine, CI-backed
pnpm --filter @wittgenstein/cli exec wittgenstein sensor  "stable ECG" --dry-run --out artifacts/demo/ecg.json
pnpm --filter @wittgenstein/cli exec wittgenstein audio   "soft launch music" --route music --dry-run
pnpm --filter @wittgenstein/cli exec wittgenstein doctor
```

---

## Reproducibility

Every run leaves an artifact trail:

```
artifacts/runs/2026-04-20T14-52-33_a3f9b2/
├── manifest.json      # git SHA, lockfile hash, seed, costs, artifact SHA-256
├── llm-input.txt      # full prompt with preamble
├── llm-output.txt     # raw model output
└── artifact.{png,wav,json,html}
```

Same inputs + same seed + same lockfile → identical artifact bytes. Diffusion sampling
cannot offer this; frozen VQ decoding does. See [`docs/reproducibility.md`](docs/reproducibility.md).

## Extensibility

Two surfaces, one contract. Adding a modality takes six steps on either side. See
[`docs/extending.md`](docs/extending.md) for concrete recipes covering:

- A new codec (TypeScript and Python)
- A new LLM provider
- A new trained adapter
- A new benchmark case
- Non-negotiable rules (decoder ≠ generator, no silent fallbacks, schema at every boundary)

---

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wittgenstein-cli/wittgenstein.git
cd wittgenstein

# TypeScript harness
nvm use && corepack enable && pnpm install && pnpm typecheck

# Python surface
cd polyglot-mini && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requirements: Node ≥ 20.11, pnpm ≥ 9.0, Python ≥ 3.10. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for the full developer setup.

---

## Status

See [`docs/implementation-status.md`](docs/implementation-status.md) for component-level detail.
Summary: sensor, audio, polyglot-mini image fallback, and the Python image code-as-painter
path all ship today; the TS neural image codec has real scene + adapter + placeholder
latents and is waiting on a frozen VQ decoder bridge; video is a typed stub.

**What's next.** Doctrine is locked; the active workstream is the Codec Protocol v2 port
across all modalities, sequenced in [`docs/exec-plans/active/codec-v2-port.md`](docs/exec-plans/active/codec-v2-port.md)
(`M0` and `M1A` are landed; `M2 audio` is next; `M1B image depth` is tracked separately).

Roadmap: [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). Changelog: [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
Security: [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

## Experimental surfaces (⚠️ honest disclosure)

[Experimental feedback issue](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/experimental-feedback.md) — that's
the signal we most want right now.

## How to help

Wittgenstein was open-sourced straight out of a hackathon and we want early adopters to
land softly. Three paths, in order of effort:

1. **Try the 30-second quickstart above and tell us how it felt.** Broken step? Confusing
   docs? File a [`[q]` question](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/question.md) or a docs PR — we
   treat "should have been documented" as the same priority as a bug.
2. **Pick a `good first issue` on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/wittgenstein-cli/wittgenstein/issues).**
   Labelled entries are scoped small. Docs, CI, and typings are all fair game.
3. **Own a surface.** If you want to land the VQ decoder bridge, train a better adapter,
   or port a codec, say so in an issue and we'll pair. See
   [`docs/extending.md`](docs/extending.md) for the concrete recipes.

Before sending a PR, skim [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — the branch workflow is
worth two minutes and prevents the usual fork-and-merge pain.

Questions before you start? [`SUPPORT.md`](SUPPORT.md) shows where to ask what.

## Locked constraints

These are the contracts the v0.2 doctrine lock made non-negotiable. Full pack with
sources: [`docs/hard-constraints.md`](docs/hard-constraints.md).

- **Five layers, locked vocabulary** — Harness · Codec · Spec · IR · Decoder · Adapter ·
  Packaging. No alternative naming, no shadow layers. ([`docs/glossary.md`](docs/glossary.md))
- **Codec Protocol v2 is the only codec contract** — every codec implements
  `Codec<Req, Art>.produce`. The harness does not branch on modality. (RFC-0001 / ADR-0008)
- **Decoder ≠ generator** — decoders are deterministic functions of (Spec, seed,
  lockfile). No diffusion samplers in the core image path. (ADR-0005)
- **Path C rejected through v0.4** — no Chameleon/LlamaGen-style fused multimodal retrain;
  the base model stays text-only. (ADR-0007)
- **IR is a sum type** — `Text | Latent | Hybrid`; only `Text` is inhabited at v0.2. New
  IR variants require an ADR. (ADR-0011)
- **Schema at every LLM boundary** — preamble injected, zod-parsed on return, no free-form
  prose accepted as structured output.
- **Manifest spine, no exceptions** — every run writes git SHA, lockfile hash, seed, full
  LLM I/O, and artifact SHA-256 under `artifacts/runs/<id>/`. No silent fallbacks.
- **Shared contracts live in `@wittgenstein/schemas`** — codec packages depend on schemas,
  not on each other.
