> *Die Grenzen meiner Sprache bedeuten die Grenzen meiner Welt.* — Tractatus 5.6

The limits of a language model's expression are the limits of what a harness built on top
of it can plan. Wittgenstein's response is to extend what the model can **express as structured
files** — schemas, codec IR, latent codes — rather than what it can **say in tokens**. The
expressive contract lives in code, not prompt copy.

> **🧪 Project status — early-stage, post-hackathon.** Wittgenstein is a prerelease
> (`v0.1.0-alpha.2`) with a working Python surface, a production-shaped TypeScript
> harness, and a few intentionally unfinished surfaces clearly flagged with ⚠️ or 🔴 in
> [`docs/implementation-status.md`](docs/implementation-status.md). Breaking changes are
> possible before `0.1.0`. **We are actively looking for early adopters and
> contributors** — see [How to help](#how-to-help) below.

## Why this exists

Most "multimodal AI" stacks hide the hard parts in a fused frontier model, a paid cloud
API, or the slide deck. None of those are portable, inspectable, or reproducible.

Wittgenstein makes three architectural bets instead:

- **Text LLMs, not fused multimodal giants.** The base model stays text-only. Modality-specific
  work lives in codec layers. Cross-modal grounding is already inside the LLM — the adapter
  teaches the interface, not the knowledge. ([research/frozen-llm-multimodality.md](docs/research/frozen-llm-multimodality.md))
- **Decoder, not generator.** Frozen VQ decoders over diffusion samplers. Reproducibility is
  structural — same IR + same seed → same bytes — not a policy bolt-on. ([research/vq-tokens-as-interface.md](docs/research/vq-tokens-as-interface.md))
- **Traceable by construction.** Every run writes a manifest with git SHA, lockfile hash,
  seed, full LLM input/output, and artifact SHA-256. Runs replay bit-exactly. ([reproducibility.md](docs/reproducibility.md))

## Architecture (Five Layers)

```
 User prompt
      │
      ▼
  L1 HARNESS          routing · retry · budget · manifest · seed
      │
      ▼
  L2 IR / CODEC       LLM → structured JSON (scene spec / audio plan / signal spec)
      │   ▲
      │   └── schema preamble injected before the LLM call
      ▼
  L3 RENDERER         JSON → real file
      │               image:  frozen VQ decoder     → PNG
      │               audio:  WAV synth + ambient   → WAV / M4A
      │               sensor: operator expand       → CSV + loupe HTML
      ▼
  L4 ADAPTER          text embedding → latent code alignment (image only; tiny MLP)
      │               (fires between L2 and L3; no adapter for audio/sensor today)
      ▼
  L5 DIST             CLI · npm · AGENTS.md · artifacts/runs/<id>/manifest.json
```

Every layer has a named home in the repo; no layer is "implied in prompts." See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the full mapping.

## Quickstart (30 seconds, no API key)

```bash
cd polyglot-mini
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m polyglot.cli sensor "ECG 72 bpm resting" --dry-run --out /tmp/ecg.json
open /tmp/ecg.html    # self-contained interactive dashboard, zero deps
```

What you get:

```
/tmp/
├── ecg.json    operator spec + 2,500 samples
├── ecg.csv     timeSec,value
├── ecg.png     matplotlib chart
└── ecg.html    117 KB interactive loupe dashboard
```

Full tour: [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md).

## Two surfaces, one architecture

| Surface | Lives at | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Python prototype** | `polyglot-mini/` | Rapid iteration, demos, adapter training, hackathon velocity |
| **TypeScript harness** | `packages/*` | Typed contracts, strict CI gates, production distribution |

Both implement the same five layers. Start on the Python side, graduate to TypeScript when
the codec design is stable. See [`docs/extending.md`](docs/extending.md) for the porting recipe.

---

## CLI

```bash
# Python surface — full end-to-end, works today
python3 -m polyglot.cli image  "stormy ocean at midnight"      --out ocean.png
python3 -m polyglot.cli tts    "Cozy rainy afternoon."         --out voice.m4a
python3 -m polyglot.cli sensor "ECG 72 bpm resting" --dry-run  --out ecg.json

# TypeScript surface — typed harness, manifest spine, CI-backed
pnpm --filter @wittgenstein/cli exec wittgenstein sensor  "stable ECG" --dry-run --out artifacts/demo/ecg.json
pnpm --filter @wittgenstein/cli exec wittgenstein audio   "soft launch music" --route music --dry-run
pnpm --filter @wittgenstein/cli exec wittgenstein doctor
```

---

## Reproducibility

Every run leaves an artifact trail:

```
artifacts/runs/2026-04-20T14-52-33_a3f9b2/
├── manifest.json      # git SHA, lockfile hash, seed, costs, artifact SHA-256
├── llm-input.txt      # full prompt with preamble
├── llm-output.txt     # raw model output
└── artifact.{png,wav,json,html}
```

Same inputs + same seed + same lockfile → identical artifact bytes. Diffusion sampling
cannot offer this; frozen VQ decoding does. See [`docs/reproducibility.md`](docs/reproducibility.md).

## Extensibility

Two surfaces, one contract. Adding a modality takes six steps on either side. See
[`docs/extending.md`](docs/extending.md) for concrete recipes covering:

- A new codec (TypeScript and Python)
- A new LLM provider
- A new trained adapter
- A new benchmark case
- Non-negotiable rules (decoder ≠ generator, no silent fallbacks, schema at every boundary)

---

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moapacha/wittgenstein.git
cd wittgenstein

# TypeScript harness

```

Requirements: Node ≥ 20.11, pnpm ≥ 9.0, Python ≥ 3.10. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for the full developer setup.

---

## Status

See [`docs/implementation-status.md`](docs/implementation-status.md) for component-level detail.
Summary: sensor, audio, polyglot-mini image fallback, and the Python image code-as-painter
path all ship today; the TS neural image codec has real scene + adapter + placeholder
latents and is waiting on a frozen VQ decoder bridge; video is a typed stub.

Roadmap: [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). Changelog: [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
Security: [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

---

## Experimental surfaces (⚠️ honest disclosure)

These are intentionally unfinished. They're part of the current release so the contract
is visible, but **do not depend on them in production** until the status matrix says
✅ Ships.

| Surface | State | What works today | What's missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| TS `codec-image` adapter + decoder | ⚠️ Partial | Scene JSON, placeholder latents, MLP loader, `renderSky` / `renderTerrain` primitives | Frozen VQ decoder bridge (LlamaGen / SEED); trained adapter weights |
| TS `codec-video` | 🔴 Stub | Schema + typed interface | HyperFrames integration, MP4 encoder |
| Benchmark quality scores | ⚠️ Proxy | Structural smoke checks, cost/latency timing | CLIPScore, Whisper WER, UTMOS, discriminative score runners |
| `polyglot-mini` image code-as-painter sandbox | ⚠️ Research-grade | `subprocess` with 20 s timeout + safe globals | Kernel-level isolation for multi-tenant use (see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)) |

If you hit a rough edge in one of these, file an
[Experimental feedback issue](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/experimental-feedback.md) — that's
the signal we most want right now.

## How to help

Wittgenstein was open-sourced straight out of a hackathon and we want early adopters to
land softly. Three paths, in order of effort:

1. **Try the 30-second quickstart above and tell us how it felt.** Broken step? Confusing
   docs? File a [`[q]` question](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/question.md) or a docs PR — we
   treat "should have been documented" as the same priority as a bug.
2. **Pick a `good first issue` on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Moapacha/wittgenstein/issues).**
   Labelled entries are scoped small. Docs, CI, and typings are all fair game.
3. **Own a surface.** If you want to land the VQ decoder bridge, train a better adapter,
   or port a codec, say so in an issue and we'll pair. See
   [`docs/extending.md`](docs/extending.md) for the concrete recipes.

Before sending a PR, skim [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — the branch workflow is
worth two minutes and prevents the usual fork-and-merge pain.

Questions before you start? [`SUPPORT.md`](SUPPORT.md) shows where to ask what.

---

## Locked constraints

- Image has exactly one shipping path: LLM → JSON scene spec → adapter → frozen decoder → PNG
- No diffusion generators in the core image path
- No silent fallbacks — failures return structured errors with a manifest
- Every run is traceable under `artifacts/runs/`
- Shared contracts live in `@wittgenstein/schemas`; codec packages depend on schemas, not each other
