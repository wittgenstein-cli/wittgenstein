## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0-alpha.1] — 2026-04-25 — v0.2 doctrine lock (pre-launch)

Doctrine lock for v0.2. **No code changes** — this cut is the paper
trail that the next phase (P6 — codec-v2 port, M0→M5b) executes
against. Tagged as a pre-launch so contributors can reference a stable
SHA for the doctrine surface while M0/M1 work begins on top of it.

### Added — Foundational
- `docs/THESIS.md` — smallest locked statement of the project
- `docs/inheritance-audit.md` — keep / promote / revise / retire ledger
- `docs/glossary.md` — locked vocabulary (Harness / Codec / Spec / IR /
  Decoder / Adapter / Packaging) per ADR-0011
- `docs/tracks.md` — Researcher / Hacker dual-track contract
- `docs/contributor-map.md` — onboarding map for humans + agents
- `docs/SYNTHESIS_v0.2.md` — end-of-phase rollup
- `docs/v02-alignment-review.md`, `docs/v02-final-audit.md` — audit ledgers

### Added — Research briefs (`docs/research/briefs/`)

- `B_compression_vs_world_models.md` — Ilya ↔ LeCun position
- `C_unproven_horizon.md` — v0.3 horizon scan
- `D_cli_and_sdk_conventions.md` — CLI / SDK conventions audit
- `E_benchmarks_v2.md` — per-modality quality benchmarks
- `F_site_reconciliation.md` — site ↔ repo reconciliation
- `G_image_network_clues.md` — image decoder / data / packaging
  (M1 prerequisite, Draft v0.1)

### Added — RFCs (`docs/rfcs/`)
- `0001-codec-protocol-v2.md` — `Codec<Req, Art>.produce` primitive
  (🟢 ratified by ADR-0008)
- `0002-cli-ergonomics.md` — CLI v2 (🟢 ratified by ADR-0009)
- `0003-naming-pass.md` — ⛔ superseded by RFC-0005
- `0004-site-reconciliation.md` — site rewrite plan
- `0005-naming-lock-v2.md` — naming v2 (🟢 ratified by ADR-0011)

### Added — ADRs (`docs/adrs/`)
- `0006-layered-epistemology.md` — verdict of brief B
- `0007-path-c-rejected.md` — Chameleon-style retrain rejected through v0.4

### Added — Execution
- `docs/exec-plans/active/codec-v2-port.md` — live P6 plan, M0→M5b,
  image-first execution order
- `docs/agent-guides/` — prompt-ready execution briefs
  (`image-to-audio-port.md`, `audio-port.md`, `sensor-port.md`)
- `docs/exec-plans/archive/` — historical day-1 fragments with
  subsumption notes

### Added — Engineering discipline
- `.claude/AGENT_PROMPT.md` — agent orientation (locked vocabulary,
  read-before-write, escalation rules)
- `docs/engineering-discipline.md` — working standards fused from
  Jah-yee/cursor-rules, specialised for Wittgenstein

### Changed
- `AGENTS.md` — leads with `.claude/AGENT_PROMPT.md` and
  `docs/engineering-discipline.md` before doctrine; locked-constraints
  section refreshed against v0.2 vocabulary
- `docs/hard-constraints.md` — rewritten from 9-line stub to canonical
  v0.2 constraint pack (architecture / runtime / packages / process /
  out-of-scope)
- `docs/codecs/audio.md` — rewritten with per-route decoder rationale,
  failure modes, honest risk statement
- `docs/codecs/sensor.md` — rewritten as no-L4 confirmation case;
  byte-for-byte parity required
- `docs/codecs/video.md` — marked 🔴 stub awaiting post-v0.3 M-slot
- `docs/index.md` — surfaces THESIS, briefs A–G, RFCs 0001–0005,
  ADRs 0006–0011, agent-guides, codec-v2-port
- `README.md` — doc-pack expanded with contributor-map, glossary,
  tracks, agent-guides, RFCs, ADRs

### Maintenance
- Repo migrated to `p-to-q/wittgenstein` org;
  changelog compare links updated accordingly
- `.github/dependabot.yml` — github-actions updates grouped to reduce
  PR noise
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — tag-driven GitHub Release with
  CHANGELOG-section body; `-alpha`/`-beta`/`-rc`/`-pre` versions
  auto-marked as prerelease
- `.github/workflows/auto-merge-dependabot.yml` — auto-squash-merge
  Dependabot PRs that are minor/patch or grouped, after required
  checks pass. Major-version bumps still require human review.

### Changed — CI hygiene
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` split into `verify-code` (full Node +
  Python suite) and `verify-docs` (prettier-only fast lane), gated by
  `dorny/paths-filter` so docs-only PRs no longer pay for the full
  Node + Python verify. Pattern: pre-launch had been merging on red
  because docs PRs always tripped CI on irrelevant signal; the new
  shape gives green-on-green on docs-only changes in &lt;30s and full
  validation on code touches.
- `.prettierrc` — added `proseWrap: "preserve"` so prose markdown is
  no longer reflowed (was the recurring source of red docs CI).
- `format:check:maintained` — dropped `docs/research/briefs/**/*.md`
  from the prettier glob; briefs are prose, not config.

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] — 2026-04-20 — Early-adopter polish

Second prerelease. No API surface changes; this cut is about making the project
**legible and welcoming to early adopters and contributors** before we keep moving.

### Added
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` — Contributor Covenant 2.1 summary with project-specific notes
- `SUPPORT.md` — where to ask what, expected response times, how to file an effective issue
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/question.md` — low-friction "how do I..." template
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/experimental-feedback.md` — explicit channel for feedback on
  ⚠️ Partial / 🔴 Stub surfaces, the signal we most want right now
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` — disables blank issues, surfaces SUPPORT.md and the
  implementation-status matrix before new issues are filed
- README sections:
  - **Project status** banner at the top (early-stage, prerelease, breaking changes possible)
  - **Experimental surfaces** table with honest disclosure of ⚠️/🔴 items
  - **How to help** — three scoped paths from "try quickstart and tell us" to "own a surface"
  - Release and Status badges, plus PRs-welcome badge

### Changed
- `README.md` — adds status banner, experimental-surfaces table, how-to-help section,
  docs-map entries for `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SUPPORT.md`; badge set updated to include
  Release and Status; Node version badge corrected to 20.19
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — rewritten for early contributors: first-time setup (both surfaces),
  "where to start" table by difficulty, explicit branch workflow with fork-sync instructions,
  experimental-vs-shipping rules, docs-only fast-path
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — friendlier tone, surface checkboxes, separate section
  for experimental/RFC PRs, reminder to update `docs/implementation-status.md` when adding
  new ⚠️/🔴 surfaces
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug.md` — asks for surface, environment versions, and the
  run manifest (single most useful debug artifact)
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md` — five-layer checklist, hard-constraint confirmation,
  willingness-to-contribute signal
- `benchmarks/README.md` — explicit ⚠️ banner clarifying that today's quality scores are
  structural proxies, not research-grade metrics

### Fixed
- Synced fork `origin/main` (Jah-yee) to `upstream/main` (Moapacha) — was 402 files behind
- Deleted three merged / superseded remote branches on the fork:
  `chore/repo-root-wittgenstein`, `feat/foundation-framework`,
  `docs/root-docs-readme-changelog`

### Removed
- `.claude/skills/site-clone/`, `.codex/skills/site-clone/`, `.cursor/commands/site-clone.md`
  — generic website-cloning skill files, unrelated to Wittgenstein
- `Kimi_Agent_克隆 aquin/` (91 files, ~6.8 MB) — standalone Vite app unrelated to the project
- `DESIGN.md` (20 KB) — Claude design-system notes used as input for the removed
  site-clone skill; not referenced by any Wittgenstein doc or code path
- `research/chat2svg-lora/__pycache__/` — Python bytecode cache, never belongs in git
- `.gitignore` hardened: `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, `**/__pycache__/`, `**/*.pyc`
  added so these categories do not leak back

### Maintenance
- Root `package.json` version bumped `0.0.0` → `0.1.0-alpha.2` to match the tag

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] — 2026-04-20 — Early Preview

First public prerelease before the formal `0.1.0` cut. This snapshot is the current
verified stage build: enough of the system ships to produce real files, benchmark dry
runs, and exercise the core harness contracts, while the neural image decoder bridge and
video renderer remain intentionally incomplete.

### Added
- TypeScript monorepo (`packages/*`) with pnpm workspaces, strict mode, project references
- `@wittgenstein/schemas` — shared zod codec contract, `RunManifest`, `Modality`
- `@wittgenstein/core` — harness runtime with routing, retry, budget, telemetry, manifest spine, seed control
- `@wittgenstein/codec-image` — neural codec skeleton: LLM → JSON scene spec → adapter → frozen decoder → PNG
- `@wittgenstein/codec-audio` — speech, soundscape, music routes with ambient layering
- `@wittgenstein/codec-sensor` — deterministic operator-spec signal generation + loupe HTML dashboard
- `@wittgenstein/codec-video` — composition IR scaffold
- `@wittgenstein/cli` — `wittgenstein` command with init, image, audio, tts, video, sensor, doctor subcommands
- `polyglot-mini/` — Python rapid-prototype surface implementing the same five layers end-to-end
- `loupe.py` — zero-dependency CSV/JSON → self-contained interactive HTML dashboard
- `apps/site/` — Next.js 14 App Router site scaffold
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — install, lint, typecheck, test on push and PR
- Apache 2.0 license
- `docs/research/vq-tokens-as-interface.md` — core design note explaining why discrete VQ tokens are the chosen LLM–decoder interface
- `docs/implementation-status.md` — honest Ships / Partial / Stub matrix across Python + TS surfaces
- `docs/quickstart.md` — 30-second tour producing real files (sensor, audio, image paths)
- `docs/extending.md` — concrete recipes for adding codecs and adapters in both surfaces
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `SECURITY.md` at repo root
- Baseline results table in `benchmarks/README.md` (dry-run 2026-04)
- Adapter training baselines: image style MLP (781 COCO examples, 9 s, val BCE 0.7698) and audio ambient classifier (369 examples, < 5 s)

### Changed
- Root `README.md` — restructured for engineer / hacker / researcher readability; receipts table; two-surface positioning; extensibility section
- `docs/benchmark-standards.md` — full measurement protocol, per-modality quality-proxy scoring breakdown, real measured baselines
- Research notes (`compression-view-of-llms.md`, `frozen-llm-multimodality.md`, `neural-codec-references.md`) rewritten from stubs to full arguments with citations
- `polyglot-mini/README.md` — explicit five-layer mapping, precise MLP architecture numbers, provider routing table, decoder ≠ generator section
- `.env.example` — added LLM provider keys (Moonshot / MiniMax / OpenAI / Anthropic)
- `packages/codec-sensor/src/render.ts` — promoted dynamic imports to static top-level; hoisted `__dir` to module scope
- `polyglot-mini/train/train.py` and `train_audio.py` — suppress numpy overflow / divide-by-zero RuntimeWarnings during training

### Fixed
- Deleted stale merged branches `chore/repo-root-wittgenstein` and `feat/foundation-framework`
- Removed pointless `.gitkeep` at repo root and empty legacy `train/` directory

### Locked
- Image has exactly one path: `LLM → JSON scene → adapter → frozen decoder → PNG`
- No diffusion generators, no SVG/HTML/Canvas fallbacks for image
- Every run writes a manifest under `artifacts/runs/<id>/`
- Shared contracts live in `@wittgenstein/schemas`; codec packages depend on schemas, not each other
