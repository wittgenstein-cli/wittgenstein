# Workflow Example Pack

35 real artifacts produced through the Wittgenstein harness — 5 per modality group,
plus 7 hand-picked samples mirrored under [`samples/`](samples/).

> **This is a reference pack.** It was generated using curated local JSON responses so
> the runs stay reproducible without hitting an external LLM, but every run still writes
> a full manifest under `artifacts/runs/<run-id>/manifest.json` (git SHA, seed, LLM
> input/output, artifact SHA-256). You can regenerate any of these bit-for-bit.
>
> For a nicer rendered gallery, see the top-level [`SHOWCASE.md`](../../../SHOWCASE.md).

## Notes

- **Image** uses the sole neural path: `scene spec → adapter → frozen decoder → PNG`.
  The showcase set routes through a narrow-domain reference decoder bridge inside that
  path so the demo looks less abstract while staying harness-compatible. `02-forest`
  is now pinned to a verified prior-run workflow image, and
  `samples/image/03-forest-alt.png` is a second verified local example from the same
  workflow lineage. The full VQ decoder bridge is still ⚠️ Partial; see
  [`../../../docs/implementation-status.md`](../../../docs/implementation-status.md).
- **TTS** uses the audio speech route. On macOS it upgrades to `say` + `afconvert`
  automatically; elsewhere it uses the stdlib WAV synth.
- **Music** and **soundscape** stay on the local audio runtime (pure stdlib + numpy).
- **Sensor** outputs always include JSON, CSV, and an interactive HTML dashboard
  (~117 KB, zero external deps) — open the `.html` directly, no build step.
- Every artifact has a corresponding run manifest under
  [`../../runs/`](../../runs/).
