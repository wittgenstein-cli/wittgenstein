# Inheritance Audit — what carries forward, what doesn't

> **Purpose.** As Wittgenstein enters the v0.2 restructuring phase, this document enumerates every claim, bet, stub, and convention currently carried by the repo and explicitly files it under **Keep**, **Promote**, **Revise**, or **Retire**. Nothing is allowed to silently survive; nothing is allowed to silently die.

**Companion to:** [`THESIS.md`](THESIS.md) (what is locked) and the phased v0.2 plan (what we do about everything else).

**Dated:** 2026-04-23 · **Review cadence:** after P2 research briefs land.

## How to read this doc

Every row has four fields:

| Field      | Meaning                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Item**   | The claim, convention, or artifact                            |
| **Source** | Where it's written down today (file path, ADR, or PPT/verbal) |
| **Status** | `Keep` / `Promote` / `Revise` / `Retire`                      |
| **Action** | Follow-up doc, RFC, or ADR that handles it (or "—" if closed) |

`Keep` = frozen. `Promote` = already believed but not yet written down; needs first-class doc. `Revise` = open question, goes into an RFC. `Retire` = scheduled for deprecation; retiring ADR must cite what replaces it.

## §2 — Promote: believed but not yet first-class (write down in P2)

These are things we already act as if we've decided, but the decision lives in slides, chat, or the back of `compression-view-of-llms.md`. P2 turns each into a citable doc.

## §4 — Retire: scheduled for deprecation (ADR required to ship)

## §5 — Not-in-scope-this-phase (parked, documented for honesty)

These items show up in conversation but are explicitly **not** decided in P1–P5. They are parked so nobody re-litigates them inside the current phase.

| #   | Question                                                  | Why parked                                                   | What would un-park it                            |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| N-1 | Shipping a real LlamaGen / Emu3 / SEED decoder bridge     | Belongs to P6 execution + a separate research spike          | RFC-0001 landed; decoder choice follows          |
| N-2 | Shipping a real JEPA-style planner inside L1+             | Conditional on R2 verdict                                    | Brief R2 verdict is _Layered_ (position iii)     |
| N-3 | Rewriting `wittgenstein.wtf`                              | Needs R6 diff first                                          | RFC-0004 merged                                  |
| N-4 | New modality (e.g. 3D, embodied action, tabular, tactile) | RFC-0001 must land before new surfaces are added             | ADR-0008 merged                                  |
| N-5 | Real perceptual benchmarks (CLIPScore, WER, UTMOS)        | Needs R5 survey first                                        | Brief R5 merged                                  |
| N-6 | Fine-tuning _any_ base LLM                                | Violates delay-training principle; only adapters are trained | Would require superseding `THESIS.md` + ADR-0004 |

## Change policy

- Rows can move _toward_ the locked columns (Revise → Keep, Promote → Keep) without an ADR, if a merged brief or RFC provides the evidence.
- Rows cannot move _out of_ Keep without an ADR that supersedes the relevant prior ADR.
- A new row can be added at any time by PR; it starts in Revise by default.

---

## Verification

- Every `Promote` row names a specific brief or ADR that will carry it.
- Every `Revise` row names a specific RFC or brief as its decision venue.
- Every `Retire` row names its replacement.
- Every `Parked` row names its un-park condition.

If any row breaks one of these four invariants, this doc has a bug and must be patched before it merges.
