# Research/System Audit — 2026-04

**Date:** 2026-04-27
**Status:** Working note v0.2 (salvaged from PR #78; lightly edited for forward-references to docs that did not land)
**Author:** engineering (Codex), salvage edit by Claude
**Purpose:** Audit the repo's current research / decision surfaces, focusing on three questions:

1. are `Research Note -> Brief / RFC / ADR` transitions clear in practice, or mostly clear in theory?
2. in current `audio / CLI / runtime` docs, which statements read like decisions even though they are still implementation hypotheses?
3. among older long-form research notes, which should be reclassified, archived, split, or left alone?

This note is an audit artifact, not doctrine and not an implementation brief. The findings here motivated ADRs 0013 (independent ratification) and 0014 (governance lane); see those ADRs for the locked response.

## Stage and boundaries

This audit assumes the repo is in the post-`M0`, post-`M1A`-landed, pre-`M2`
implementation stage described by the current docs stack:

- `docs/THESIS.md`
- `docs/exec-plans/active/codec-v2-port.md`
- `docs/agent-guides/audio-port.md`
- `docs/research/briefs/D_cli_and_sdk_conventions.md`
- `docs/research/briefs/J_audio_engineering_and_routes.md`
- `docs/rfcs/0002-cli-ergonomics.md`
- `docs/adrs/0009-cli-ergonomics-v2.md`

Out of scope for this audit:

- implementing `M2`
- reviewing or ratifying PR #72
- replacing Claude's blocked decoder/model-side research line
- normalizing or deleting local branches

The job here is to make the research/decision surface easier to trust, not to expand the
project's doctrine.

---

## Executive judgment

The repo's research system is now structurally reasonable, but it reached that state in
layers rather than all at once.

Two things are true at the same time:

1. the current model is mostly sound:
   - `brief -> RFC -> ADR -> exec-plan -> code` is a real operating pattern
   - `Research Note` now has a useful home and a promotion path
   - top-level research aggregation (`program.md`) exists and is coherent
2. there is still residual drift from the earlier phase:
   - some execution docs still phrase hypotheses as if they were settled decisions
   - some theory/reference files were still grouped as generic notes when they are
     actually different note subtypes
   - branch state is noisier than the docs state and should be treated as a later hygiene pass

Net: the system does **not** need a new layer. It needs light reclassification, better
distinction between hypothesis and ratified decision, and a later branch cleanup once
active reviews settle.

---

## 1. Conversion audit — how research actually becomes decisions

### Working conclusion

The intended conversion chain is:

`finding -> research note -> brief / issue -> RFC -> ADR / exec-plan -> code`

ADR-0014 makes this explicit and adds a parallel governance lane (`(Governance Note →) ADR → inline summary`) for meta-process decisions.

The repo's real history shows that the chain is often **compressed** rather than
walked literally. The important question is therefore not "did every item pass every
stage," but "is it still clear which surface currently owns the claim?"

### Concrete conversion examples

| Example                            | Observed chain in practice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Assessment                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CLI/runtime surface                | `finding` from external CLI survey -> [Brief D](briefs/D_cli_and_sdk_conventions.md) -> [RFC-0002](../rfcs/0002-cli-ergonomics.md) -> [ADR-0009](../adrs/0009-cli-ergonomics-v2.md) -> [Issue #77](https://github.com/wittgenstein-cli/wittgenstein/issues/77) for implementation | Strong brief-to-RFC-to-ADR pattern; code follow-through is intentionally still open                                                      |
| Codec v2 engineering shape         | code-smell inventory + prior-art findings -> [Brief H](briefs/H_codec_engineering_prior_art.md) -> [RFC-0001](../rfcs/0001-codec-protocol-v2.md) -> [ADR-0008](../adrs/0008-codec-protocol-v2-adoption.md) -> `exec-plan` / `agent-guides` / code-port line                       | Strong decision ownership; the remaining risk is execution docs overstating particular implementation tactics                            |
| Site/repo narrative reconciliation | capture + repo drift -> [Brief F](briefs/F_site_reconciliation.md) -> [RFC-0004](../rfcs/0004-site-reconciliation.md) -> docs/site follow-through                                                                                                                                 | Good example of a reversible, ops-style RFC path that does **not** need an ADR                                                           |
| Naming lock                        | alignment review finding -> [RFC-0005](../rfcs/0005-naming-lock-v2.md) -> ADR-0011 (ratified) -> glossary / AGENTS / docs surface                                                                                                                                                 | Clear example that some claims can move directly from finding to RFC when they are interface/governance-heavy rather than research-heavy |

### Ambiguous or still-young boundaries

Two boundary zones are still not fully settled in practice:

1. **scope note vs object study vs theory note**
   - this distinction is currently implicit; promotion to explicit (e.g. via subdirectories or filename prefix) is deferred until at least one new object study is requested
   - before that, object research could too easily masquerade as stage scope

2. **prior-art brief vs execution hypothesis**
   - Brief H is correctly labeled as prior-art research, but parts of the downstream
     `audio-port.md` / `codec-v2-port.md` surfaces still sound more ratified than the evidence warrants

### Is the policy sufficient?

**Judgment:** mostly yes, with one small clarification follow-up.

The overall policy (`finding -> research note -> brief / issue -> RFC -> ADR`) is strong enough, but a small clarification helps: top-level research notes are not one undifferentiated bucket. The distinction between
**scope notes**, **object studies**, **theory notes**, and **reference sheets** should be made explicit when the first concrete demand for it appears (e.g. a second object study).

That is a lightweight taxonomy clarification, not a new research layer.

---

## 2. Hypothesis-vs-decision audit — audio / CLI / runtime

### Classification rules used here

- **locked decision** — already ratified by ADR or clearly owned by an accepted RFC
- **current best hypothesis** — a plausible execution/default choice, but not yet a ratified policy
- **needs research before ratification** — important, but upstream evidence is still incomplete
- **drift / should be rewritten** — wording is stale or stronger than the repo's actual state

### Audit conclusion for this group

The CLI/runtime side is structurally healthier than the audio execution side.

- The **CLI contract** has already crossed into ratified territory.
- The **audio/M2 execution shape** still contains a few sentences where a likely
  implementation tactic is written as if it were a settled architectural outcome.

That is a documentation hygiene issue, not a doctrine crisis.

## 3. Long-form note classification table

| Surface                       | Current role                         | Recommended action | Why                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `compression-view-of-llms.md` | thesis-adjacent argument             | relabel            | strong conceptual note, but it behaves more like a theory note than a generic research note |
| `frozen-llm-multimodality.md` | thesis-adjacent argument             | relabel            | same pattern; conceptually important, not a broad scan                                      |
| `vq-tokens-as-interface.md`   | architecture/theory note             | relabel            | explains a specific interface argument; better typed as theory note                         |
| `neural-codec-references.md`  | annotated source sheet               | relabel            | already behaves like a reference sheet, not a normal note                                   |
| `www.aquin.app/*`             | capture / extraction scratch surface | relabel            | should be treated as captured research artifact, not compared directly to notes/briefs      |

### What does **not** need to happen yet

No old long-form note in this set clearly needs archive **right now**.

The stronger need is to make their roles explicit so they are not mistaken for:

- decision records
- active execution guides
- generic "miscellaneous research"

Promotion can happen later, but only if one of these theory/reference notes starts
driving a concrete RFC or brief.

Repo-wide follow-through for those choices uses [`docs/archive-policy.md`](../archive-policy.md),
which distinguishes refresh / reclassify / archive / delete.

## 4. Non-Google object shortlist — balance correction

This repo should not over-index on Google just because one object study landed first.

The following external objects are worth keeping in view, each with only one narrow
judgment for the current stage.

| Object                                              | Why it matters                                                                                                      | Bucket                            | Label           |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| OpenAI runtime / Responses / background mode        | strong comparison object for file/tool/runtime surfaces and background execution posture                            | execution-serving                 | recommend now   |
| Anthropic / MCP / managed-agent surface             | important for future agent-runtime standards and managed-session framing, but not the current implementation center | horizon-only                      | keep for future |
| Meta / open-weight multimodal and tokenizer signals | useful for decoder/tokenizer horizon signals, not a near-term execution dependency                                  | horizon-only                      | keep for future |
| Piper / Coqui TTS / whisper.cpp                     | directly relevant to audio runtime and CLI/inference surface comparisons                                            | execution-serving                 | recommend now   |
| Fastify / Hono / tRPC / Express / Apollo Federation | high-value engineering-borrow set for route ownership, composition, and contrast cases                              | engineering-borrow                | recommend now   |
| TEN / Remotion / HyperFrames                        | useful media/runtime references, especially for future video/backend classification, but not current center-stage   | engineering-borrow / horizon-only | keep for future |

This is enough to de-skew the current-stage scope without turning the audit into a new
broad survey.

## 5. Branch convergence appendix (advisory only)

### Current headline

Local `main` is currently diverged:

- `ahead 2`
- `behind 16`

This is a real repo hygiene problem, but not one to solve during the audit while active
review surfaces are still open.

### Live review branches

These branches still correspond to active open PRs and should be treated as live:

- `codex/research-scope-google` -> PR #78
- `codex/two-review-discipline` -> PR #75
- `codex/brief-j-d-audio-sweep-clean` -> PR #74
- `codex/m1a-closeout` -> PR #72 (out of scope for this audit, but still live)

### Likely stale or superseded branches

These branches appear superseded, merged, or otherwise non-primary:

- `codex/brief-j-d-audio-sweep` — superseded by `codex/brief-j-d-audio-sweep-clean`
- `docs/m1-prep` — likely superseded by later M1A work
- `docs/promote-engineering-discipline` — likely superseded by later merged discipline/doc-surface work
- `docs/readme-prompt-upstream` — likely superseded by later merged prompt/readme stabilization
- `docs/brief-a-lineage-refresh` / `docs/brief-c-horizon-amendments` — appear merged already and remain as leftover local branches

### Special branch

- `codex/main-pre-linearize-backup` should be treated as a deliberate backup until a
  separate hygiene pass explicitly retires it.

### Recommendation

Do not converge or delete branches in this audit round.

Revisit branch cleanup only after:

- active PR review bottlenecks clear
- Claude-side blocked work resumes
- local `main` can be reconciled in a dedicated hygiene pass

---

## 6. Final conclusion

The repo's research system is now strong enough to support disciplined work, but it is
still carrying some residue from a faster, more improvisational phase.

The core pattern is healthy:

- research now has a top-level program map
- note/brief/RFC/ADR roles are clearer
- external object studies can live without pretending to be doctrine

The remaining work is lighter:

- soften a few audio/M2 doc claims that over-read as ratified
- keep top-level note subclasses explicit
- delay branch convergence until reviews settle

That is a manageable cleanup problem, not a structural reset.
