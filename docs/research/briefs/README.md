# Research Briefs

First-pass research briefs produced under **Phase P2** of the v0.2 Restructuring Action Outline. Each brief is a self-contained document that pressure-tests one claim, lineage, or engineering convention relevant to the Wittgenstein thesis.

## Brief shape (required)

Every brief ships with the four-station loop as grep-able headings:

```
## Steelman
## Red team
## Kill criteria
## Verdict
```

Plus a dated header and a version tag (`v0.1`, `v0.2`, …) so iteration is visible.

## Status legend

- 🟢 Merged (verdict final, cited by an ADR)
- 🟡 Draft (first pass complete; invites review)
- 🔴 Not started

## Review process

Each brief gets two reviews before its verdict is promoted to final:

1. **Researcher hat** — does this survive contact with 2024–2026 literature?
2. **Hacker hat** — if an agent read this at 2 a.m., would it write the right code?

If either hat dissents, the brief iterates; otherwise the verdict lands in an ADR and the brief is marked 🟢.

## Companion docs

- `docs/THESIS.md` — master statement these briefs pressure-test (lands in PR #6)
- `docs/inheritance-audit.md` — Keep/Promote/Revise/Retire table (lands in PR #6)
- `docs/rfcs/` — engineering decisions that ratify brief verdicts
- `docs/adrs/` — permanent record of accepted verdicts

If `docs/THESIS.md` and `docs/inheritance-audit.md` are not present in your checkout yet,
merge PR #6 first, then treat this folder as Phase P2.
